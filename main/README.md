## Raytracing In a Weekend
Implementation of the Raytracing In One Weekend book in Processing.
I'm into creative coding and wanted to learn Processing. But I'm also into Computer Graphics and wanted to learn something in that field. Mash those things into one and you have this project!

P.S's 
* I didn't actually finish this over a weekend, I spread it out over a couple of weeks.
* Would I recommend trying this in processing? No. It is very slow; multithreading is very primitive; and doesn't have some OOP constructs which would have made life easier.
* Going further than the Book, I also implemented triangles to allow for making larger hollow objects.

## Installation and Setup Instructions

Clone the repo. And run the main.pde file in Processing. As easy as it gets!
